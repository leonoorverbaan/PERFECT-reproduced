If the protest is counterproductive, I.e pushing people towards the thing they're trying to protest (as honestly I can't see how it would do the opposite), isn't that equally ""bad"" if not worse?"
0,"I'm more of a centrist, but I'm kinda surprised how many Progressives don't realize this is the strategy if you want progressives in government.  

You don't get AOCs and Bernie Sanders from flipped seats in KY and AL, you get them from Dem strongholds where they are viable.  Justice Dems don't flip seats, so if you want actual progressives in congress you gotta vote even for the shitty blue-dog democrats until the seat is safe enough to get someone further left in there.

This all ignoring the fact that *any* dem is better for the far-left than a republican"
1,From my understanding of french politics the right is too small to elect a radical nationalist and the left too fractured to rally around a radical leftist. Sounds good to me. Maybe having rational technocratic centrists run things dor a while isn't so bad. Right of center or left of center doesn't really matter. Western civilization doesn't need radical politicians in power. Good luck to Macron. On a side note the french go from election to inauguration really quickly which is cool. Never understood why we take 3 months swear someone in.

Maybe but somehow everyone is ignoring undecided voters. Almost all polls posted here are pretty bad because they should always show undecided voters as it's one of the most important factors.

Also, OP never said ""if you are not for Macron, you are not democratic"". S/he said that Le Pen is Pro-Russia, Anti-EU and seeks to destroy that line of politics in France. That's pretty public, it's basically her plan."

1,"Macron isn¬¥t part of his party though. Valls might hope for a job in Macro¬¥s cabinet.

Even if he agrees with Macron more, its still something very treacherous to do and also disrespectful to his own party and the members who voted for Hamon. Even if he doesn¬¥t agree with Hamon, he doesn¬¥t have to actively fight against him."
4,"Either way, time will tell if the doomsday predictions being made in /r/the_Donald will come true. I'm guessing they won't, especially since one of Le Pen's big things was further banning all religious clothing. The best way to piss off Muslims is to tell them they can't wear their religious clothing. 

I agree that the burka is stupid and should be banned since they do pose a risk for day to day life such as driving, but Le Pen wanted to ban headscarves as well. In my opinion, that would have made France a bigger target than ever. "

However it's possible that there's correlated error between first and second round polls for some candidates, and this one I'm not modelling.

4,"Hollande thinks French military interventions abroad contribute to battling terrorism. That's BS of course, but these military missions (e.g. helping the Malian regime battle jihadist rebels) don't amount to the kind of ""war"" that Hollande is talking about here. *Even* peace is under threat - he means that there is a danger of large-scale war or even WW3.

There are more nonbelievers in France than Christians BTW."

0,"No, I'm sorry to tell you, but if some of Macron's proposals need changes to the EU treaties (and I don't say they need, I don't know, I'm simply considering what Schaeuble said) then a majority in every single Country is required, or as I already said a government willing to accept a treaty change without a referendum."

2,"No, he isn't, and no, ""policies"" don't make people commit terrorist attacks.

1,Taking the example of Syria. It doesn't influence Syria itself but does give influence in the wider international community. Not to mention what Macron is doing here (discouraging the use of chemical weapons) is undoubtedly a good thing. Instead of criticising 'interventionism' as an Ideology look at individual policies and judge their merits.

0,It's strange how your argument mirrors that of Macron's political opposition. Do you not house any of your own opinions or do you just parrot what you've heard from a bias viewpoint?
0,Good! Merkel/Macron drawing a strong example out of this will help with the stability of the EU as a legitimate supranational institution.
1,"Yeah, and if we judge Le Pen solely on her own actions recently, take aways her father, she's a white supremacist, nazi sympathiser. She's not hiding it. "

These you tubers/personalities share the euroskpectism, anti-globalism, and end up supporting far right candidates like Le Pen and Trump.

Macron will be net-net bad for france due to immigration issues, however, if he starts taking a harder line on the immigrant crisis a la Merkel, an anti-immigrant policy run by a pro business leftist (yes they exist, at least in Europe!) has a much better hope than an outright nationalist like Le Pen."
1,"A lot of French students come to Quebec due to the shared language. They all complain about how expensive it is (despite Quebec being the second most affordable province in Canada, with frees around 3K). It's a clich√© by now. 

North American French voters overwhelmingly voted for Macron so it isn't all bad... ;)"
0,"No I'm a real human. I think let me check....

Yep still human still flesh and bones."
3,If you want morons like Le Pen in power then ignoring them and calling their grievances false/racist is the way to do it. Her party has doubled it's vote share in two elections and you saw what happened in the USA. With the same amount of vote growth next election she'll be the one in power.

1,"She is against the German vision of the EU where the benefits flow back to the Reich, while the rest of Europa whither under austerity Fillon, Renzi, Tsipras, etc advocate with Merkel pulling the strings. Le Pen, I would speculate, would be for a EU that exists in reality but is dysfunctional. She's advocating border controls that already exist from Austria to Denmark. The reality is Merkel unilaterally promoted a policy that resulted in millions of muslims and the majority, including Le Pen wants nothing to do with them. "

4,"I think there's good populism such as Macron's current campaign. Populism based on loving each other and moving forward, not backwards."
0,"Trump and Le Pen both ran on a platform of personal liberty and national sovereignty, and Trump is a huge advocate of federalism in the states. I would accept populist, nationalist conservative as a label for Le Pen (negative if you wish). But I've still not received any proof, in either her policies nor her actions that she's in any way a fascist. "

0,Don't know much about Le Pen's positions but whether or not Le Pen's solutions do anything is a separate discussion from whether or not the seemingly unending string of terror attacks and the French Muslim population being in many ways unwilling to assimilate is a political issue.

0,"I guess one of the questions I have now is whether Trump can order that peaceful people get shot with tear gas and rubber bullets on Pennsylvania Avenue and still not lose any voters.

Trump supporters, please think carefully about what you really want.  Will it be okay if he next starts taking pot shots at protesters from the White House windows himself?  Is that the line where you'll finally speak up against what he's doing?  Or will it be at his coronation?"
2,Technically the first signal was the Austrian election that made this cabal of reactionaries close r/The_Hofer . After Le Pen (hopefully) loses I hope we can finally stop having an infestation of conspiracy theorists speading white nationalist propaganda everywhere.

0,"The FN's influence is probably at its lowest in a long time. Le Pen just suffered two pretty big losses at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections.

0,"The question is who should the people vote for if they want change? If it is too close to the middle, probably nothing will happen. Like with Hamon or Macron. If its too far right/left, the admired change can backfire heavily."
0,Which means that Le Pen not only lost. She came in 3rd. In a competition between two people. That has to be some kind of achievement :D
0,I assume so. Probably the right wingers closer to center will vote for Macron.
0,"Have we tried sacrificing Glenn Beck to the Volcano gods? I‚Äôm not saying it would work, but we can try"

A man accidentally doing to himself what he was trying to do to others is not morally equivalent to assassination of your political opponents. This man only got the shit scared out of him because he was in the middle of trying to set innocent people on fire."
2,Most french people seem to realize that is exactly what terrorists want. Le Pen hates Muslims. French people hate terrorists. A terrorists goal is turn the rest of the world against muslims. 
0,"As an American, thank goodness Fillon is likely out. Sick of religious zealots, and I'm from the US. "
0,This data is especially dubious because of the nature of caucusing. Supporters of non-viable candidates could cover the spread on either side.
0,"Republicans are not likely to vote for anyone other than trump. His approval rating among republicultists is staggeringly, depressingly high.

I'm not sure, Fillon has been tanking in polls and he just got charged the other day. So, I don't really see his numbers going up anytime soon.

Only way Les Republicains get into the runoff now is if Fillon steps down and Juppe takes the head of the ballot.

It's worrisome that Fillon could, but it's becoming less likely every day."

What.

Please, Le Pen is against teaching kid of immigrants at school. Don't say bullshit. She is against any kind of integration."
0,Oh my god can I steal that phrase? That‚Äôs iconic and amazing.
4,"I believe that the solution is to cooperate and relate to the good muslims, of which the vast majority are. I don't just mean governments, but ordinary people also. Then with less hate against muslims, fewer people will join isis and do acts of terrorism. However, with polititions like Farage, Trump and Le Pen, as well as many as many anonymous people on the internet, the hate looks like it will continue for a long time
"
4,"I believe the importance here is *why* they were published. That's what the investigation needs to uncover.

If, say, she was simply trying to further her political career by stirring anti-Muslim sentiments, well, that would be pretty horrific, too, wouldn't it?

There is a way to share graphic images of the real horrors that people face. It sounds like what Le Pen did wasn't it. But we'll wait and see."

You have to be so far up your own ass if you think the only reason large portions of your country disagree with your ideas is because they are being tricked.
0,"Exactly, compared to the Germans the French haven't made much of a mark on the EU in recent years which is largely due to Fran√ßois Hollande who combined a campaign based on not being Sarkozy with what appears to be a complete lack of vision.

The **relative** invisibility of France that resulted is why the ""Germany leads the EU"" shtick resonates with so many people.  "

0,"&gt;  Though I don't believe they are for Le Pen either (for clear reasons), they may have a strong absententionism in second turn which helps the FN most of the time.

Ironically, they might go against Le Pen's chances. She needs every Eurosceptic vote and even if she were to get all of Melenchon voters, she'd only have 40% of the overall vote."
2,Check out /u/Anotherlink421 comment history. He's a full on bigot. He doesn't want people to believe Le Pen's base supporters are racist because Anotherlink421 is a racist and wants people to excuse racist behaviors.  I assume you are no different.

0,"I'm really surprised that he took this line. The head to head with Le Pen is a obvious losing trade for him in this climate.

Collectively Hamon and Melenchon got 26% of the votes. It is far from a bad score. If they had found a way to make an alliance they would have been far ahead of Le Pen."

There's no need to EU governments to do anything.  Private banks themselves would have a common agenda to handicap an anti-EU, anti-globalist candidate like Le Pen.

Who said anything about contradiction?  Your problem is that your doublethink is making you blind to the EU banks' agenda because of your bias.  They're the 'good guys' right?

0,"I think they mean that it is more fitting that Putin would be called to exert influence in Chechnya regarding LGBT rights than it would for Macron to do the same in Saudia Arabia, given their respective abilities to influence domestic policy in those areas.

I'm not sure how much Macron would be able to twist the Saudi's politically, but I know any means to do it would begin and end with the enormous ongoing weapons deals."
1,A certainly interesting development. Now left and centrist voters in France need to create a strategy for the First Round - having Fillon and Le Pen advance to Round 2 by dividing into numerous small parties is not ideal from their point of view. Getting behind Macron might be the best strategy for a French center and center-left; while the French right should probably hope that these forces do not consolidate and that two conservatives manage to advance.
2,"From the article:

Le Pen's immunity has been lifted before, in 2013, by the EU parliament. She was then prosecuted in 2015 with ""incitement to discrimination over people's religious beliefs"", for comparing Muslims praying in public to the Nazi occupation of France during World War Two. Prosecutors eventually recommended the charges be dropped.

They paid off their mortgages by the time their parents died, so they spent their inheritance on... property to rent out. The grandkids... can‚Äôt afford to rent alone, are sharing with friends."
3,"&gt;But I think Macron had the correct approach when he chose to debate with Le Pen and confront her ideas head-on. He made clear the lack of ideas and policy of the FN by confronting her.

This tactic won¬¥t stop populists nevertheless; They can use soundbytes, with no real down to earth politics, because they don¬¥t intend to rule; Populists from right to left, and we in Portugal have the BE and PCP, only objective is to build troops ... it¬¥s war, either against a foreign country or against is own people."

How about rather than assuming that your political system tells yuo everything you need to know about ours, how about you listen to those of us who actually do know?

0,The article is almost completely correct on Macron's Policy which is completely transparent. French analysts I listen to say the same things. I also agree that Trump reacts to strong men so the handshake might have been a positive to him. But I'm surprised by some of their interpretations of Trump's platform. They believe Trump wants to drain the swamp? They believe he wants a stronger EU? Really?

0,"The idea is people can conjure up false emails and make them look similar to the legit ones.  With the media blackout, Macron can't refute the ones that are untrue.

The people spreading these emails are not transparency heroes.  They're unsavory but very dedicated people.  They're not above lying, not by a long shot.  It might backfire, as it is so blatantly obvious.  "
0,"Yeah, I can't see that ending even though the worst offender of that is supposed to be leaving the picture. Hopefully if Macron gets elected there can be some serious change but that is probably expecting too much.

He was just lucky he had to face Le Pen, she's awful."
3,"because democracy is all about offering people genuine participation rather than just some managerial affair, and the candidates mentioned in the article offer this. Macron did in France on a more liberal platform and was successful as well.

0,"Macron is a genius.

Like Trump, he is the ""disrupt"" candidate and is able to utilize the French election system and the chaos of Parti Socialiste to ""disrupt"" the PS/UMP/FN status quo.

Also, he uses the French left's failure to embrace new social liberal values to attract the youth vote. Seriously, he is only French presidential candidate who supports legalizing marijuana, something that every liberal except the left political elite supports."
1,"Well with Macron winning the first round in France, and D66 and GroenLinks (left neoliberal greens) gaining big in Holland, I hope they get the message.

But that doesn't say that Bernie Sanders is more right-wing than Swedish conservatives. He is probably equally if not more left-wing than the Swedish left-party. 

It just sais that the United States as of know is very far to the right. And the difference between Bernie Sanders and the US establishment is probably as big as that between Melenchon and the french. Though France is to the left of the US as a whole.  "

Me, I prefer to keep it to the basics -- which in the very first place means corporatism (it's *fascio* after all) and all the subsequent nuances (e.g., government's sectoral management -- actual management, not only regulating -- of everything, from economy to family matters).

0,"&gt;Sounds awful lot like a threat and not a ""its the natural consequence of leaving"".

That's because the sound bite was taken out of context. It was a warning that the UK should go through with it and not try to do a half-assed negotiation where after they've tried the legitimacy of the EU and the good will of its partners, they would drag their feet for as long as possible to keep their current benefits. Hollande said that the consequences should be real because Brexit is a reality now. That's what it meant. "

3,there's still a small chance she'll actually win. Biggest chance is macron. Le Pen has a big fanbase so in the first round she might win. But in the second round where only 2 people remain a lot of people will vote against her regardless of the opponent which makes it so that Macron is the clear favorite.

0,I've been following the French polls for a while and the analyses here seem inaccurate. IMO Le Pen and Macron will make it past the first round and then Le Pen will lose by a massive margin in the second round. The polls were much tighter in the Brexit and Trump votes and this one is much less likely to come about. Obviously the French should take the threat seriously but there isn't any point in fearmongering.

0,"Right, Queen Anne and the Macron-Putin meeting. But your point? What do Yaroslav's seal, the age of Moscow, and statues of Alexander the Great in FYROM have to do with anything? Honestly curious as I'm having trouble following."

4,Let me take this opportunity to thank you personally for the great contribution you have made to Macron's landslide victory. The interference from the US alt-right to subvert French democracy has really mobilized French voters to teach Le Pen a lesson. Please give my sincerest thanks to your friends at r/T_D. 
0,"Yes, you're right.  People have to give positive reasons for voting for Macron.  Attacking Le Pen is not how to get another person elected."

1,"Hollande had a weaker domestic position.  He wasn't able to be the public face of the EU in taking unpopular policies.

I don't think that the amount that they show up necessarily reflects the actual relative influence that each country has.

Don't get me wrong.  I think that having either Hollande or Merkel doing that was a bad idea.  Should gave been Juncker or Tusk or whoever always being the public face, even if internally, all the decisions were made by country-level politicians.  Makes people feel represented."
1,"This is a valuable and understated point. Even if Le Pen does not win, the number of votes she gets will be the sign of a clear discontent in the populace and Macron does need to address this before its too late."

1,"The fact 20% people voted for someone who stole tax money and 21% of them voted far right is enough for me to think they're some problems. Plus the people who believe macron is anti system, that's at least half of the population that I think is completely out of their mind."

Ask them if they would like to see violence/destruction in the suburbs where they live, because we know many on the Left want to take the protests into the suburbs. If Biden is elected would he have the guts to stand up to rioters and protect the citizenry? My guess is that he wouldn't."
0,"/r/europe confuses me. Everybody seems to be against nationalist parties here (FN, PiS, etc.) which are the only ones who wants to reduce immigration, and yet, everybody seems to be against immigration.

Isn't that a bit contradictory? If there were parties that advocated strongly reducing immigration at the scale of Europe maybe it would make sense but otherwise it feels like what people want here is to keep electing center-right politicians like Merkel/Macron and keep complaining about migrants ad nauseam?"
0,I would love to see Macron and Trudeau having romantic sex.
0,"This makes me very happy, but I hope Macron will be modest enough to understand that he mostly won because Le Pen was his adversary. He needs to prove his qualities not just to Le Pens supporters, but very much to the voters of Fillon, Melenchon, Hamon as well. A lot of work still to do. Good luck ""Macaron""! "
0,"But nobody from the left said that in France, even the ""far left"" candidate. That's why voting Le Pen is bullshit. 70% of the voters are just morons, and 30% are indecisive. "
3,"You've gotta speak the same language in a conversation to get anywhere. Trump is absolutely a 12 year old, and other world leaders have to sink to his simplicity to get their message across to him.

When Macron and others start having bullshit handshake sessions with one another, that's the time to complain. Until then it's entirely on Trump's shoulders. "

0,"Fillon is against them, as is le pen. We both know how the two round presidential primary works, and since they're both of the same opinion, it is exceedingly likely that France either removes sanctions or advocates that the EU rollback sanctions. "

The leaks might not have been the result of hacking, but that doesn't mean that there was ""No trace of Russian hacking"" as the title insinuates."
1,"Because there is evidence that the leaks we're mixed with altered emails meant to incriminate Macron. Until that's all sorted out, there not much reason to buy into the Russian's plans of leaking the docs last minute so Macron couldn't legally address any of it. "

1,"True. While we do need it I think it'll take longer for people to accept that. 

But again that's why I do believe Macron and Hamon together would be good. 

UBI will actually be really good for the economy if it's done well and, by political standards, a younger politician is more likely to be able to be convinced of that.

It has to start somewhere."

1,"Russia is  currently a far right authoritarian state,Le Pen and Putins interest converge so there is no inconsistency here."
1,"&gt; Le Pen used those images for a reason.


It was an attempt to defend herself from claims she was as bad as ISIS. If I recall correctly, the image followed something to the effect of ""That's what the real ISIS actually does."" 

Based solely on this, I wouldn't say this was inciting hatred against the Muslim faith.

But as someone pointed out, the law forbids the broadcast of violent images, regardless of intent. "

1,"I feel sorry for both the sisters. Unless Alex takes after her dad in terms of a complete lack of self-awareness, empathy and overall non-assholishness behavior, the dad may have just destroyed her relationship with her sister forever. Or at least tainted it to the point that Alex will never be able to celebrate her own achievements without a severe amount of resentment from Mary."

I guess it's sort of a eugenecist approach.  But the thing is I'm not judging or making decisions for anyone else.  Just me."
3,"He's not my guy. Honestly I don't know what else people need to see this is a blatant attempt by Le Pen and Russia to influence the election. I'm not whining, I'm complaining about what I suspect is a foreign power interfering in our democracy, and a presidential candidate being possibly associated to it, which is pretty damn close to treason if you ask me. Not that it's a surprise for a party founded by collaborationists and Nazis."
0,"As a non French I see Le Pen and Macron as wolves dressed as sheep. One being the extreme xenophobic nationalistic populist and the latter being a clear bureaucrat supporting the liberal banking system with the aim to screw up all socialist policies in France.

Socialists in any genuine sense do not want atomised welfare solutions, see for example Melenchon's rejection of the UBI. I mean I get why people mix it up, most self-proclaimed socialists nowadays have seemed to turn away from classical Marxist ideas.

0,"No they won't, Le Pen will get elected. Fillon just got himself exposed in a corruption scandal. She shares the same ideas as Trump as well as Russia. So now you've got a US-UK-France-Russia axis.

0,I believe that Macron has a much better grasp of the economic reality such as trade being mutually beneficial and Keynes being generally right but Fillon seems to have moderated Thatcher who moderated Reagan who moderated Hayek so it is quite obvious he also understands some basic principles like trade being mutually beneficial but I'm guessing he believes wealth trickles down which could not be further from the truth.

Or will she say ""**√ß'est diff√©rent hon hon hon!**""?

So how will an even more extreme tax policy help France? This is just basic laffer curve. You can tax up to 50-60% but if you go further people will leave and/or you will lose competitiveness.

0,"I have a theory on this. The deranged radical liberals see supporting Biden, who they actually dislike, as part of their brave activism.

4,"I think we can't just forget about the 11 million who supported Le Pen. You can't just rub it in their faces, label them as racist and whatnot; that's the worst thing you can do.

Remember, we are the enemy of both left and right, populists and nationalists, conservatives and libertarians - we should not falter."

Same could have been said for Macron before but looking at all the support,it's pretty possible that IF he becomes president he will get his majority.

But for M√©lenchon ?Not at all,it's a big step in the unknown if Le Pen Or M√©lenchon are elected.
Wait and see i guess,but if someone like Fillon was elected,he would get his majority without too much issues.

M√©lenchon and Le Pen are just very uncertain.People don't join those movements for their own reasons,they don't change so quickly.

Also if protestors could avoid federal property that would be in their best interest.  The federal government would lose a lot of their leverage if the property was not affected."
0,"Yes, but I don't think that's why people voted against him. Wilders gave zero practical solutions to the problems that every day citizens face. He complained, and that's all he did. Basically this arguments boiled down to 'the Muslims are the problem', it didn't matter what the issue was. The economy? Muslims are the problem. Crime? Muslims are the problem. Poverty? Muslims are the problem. Thankfully, ordinary citizens saw right through his bullshit, and realized he had zero real solutions.

Life has slowed down for many but not me. I'd much rather people watch their manners.

0,"Sure!

But I don't consider them right wing populists as they are nothing like Le Pen and the like.

Neoliberal (or centrist) populists is the good term."
0,"And there's no such thing as a perfectly neoliberal politician because a politician will inherently pick a marketable policy over a smart one if ever the two are at odds.

We see this with Hillary, with Merkel, Macron, Bill. 

We acknowledge all this which is why I don't understand the purist witchhunts people like Wumbo initiate. Yea, wage controls and bowing out of the TPP are definitely not neoliberal. 

I don't see why that makes these people irredeemable or erases their other policies."

0,Pretty much. People who think Le Pen is not a carrer politician using outdated ideological politices who has been losing since forever are in denial.
2,Yeah. I'm a muslim and I don't think le pen will ever stop terrorist attacks completely. You don't know this but terrorists in groups like ISIS want far right candidates like Le Pen to win because they can then use them as an example to rally muslims against the western world because a lot of these candidates policies negatively affect Muslims. That is why terrorist groups like ISIS had videos that showed  donald trump I think during the US election campaign talking about his muslim ban and other things that can negatively affect Muslims.
3,"Mmm, he seems to have an especially strong hate-on for Macron, doesn't he? Genuinely wonder why. "
0,"Most Fillon voters are old people. Old people are the never-FN type which is why most of them are voting for Macron. Le Pen has been trying to get them more sympathetic by being less EU- and euroskeptic and more homophobic, but that hasn't worked so far. I think the ones going for Le Pen are the more engaged and ideologically right-wing voters."

He's not, though.

He's still honorary [President of the Front National](http://www.frontnational.com/author/jeanmarielepen/).

Thoughts on that?"
3,"the EU is not a country and doesn't have its own criminal court.

0,I never claimed that the it wasn't true that some emails are false. Are you so emotionally wrapped up in this that your lashing out at people for things they're not even saying. I simply stated the fact that Macron claims they are real and that he seems to be the one who claims that some of them are also false. Is that an issue for you?
0,"That's completely different. Being an African American is not a political ideology. More, even if a Muslim runs for the presidency, does mean he will follow a radical Islam ideology. You have Fillon and Sadiq Khan. Two politicians, one Christian and the other Muslim. Yet one is more conservative than the Pope. The other voted for same sex marriage in UK. It's very unlikely that France will get a radical or conservative Islamic candidate. "
1,I hate this and honestly consider you not the best type of person.
0,"Blame Macron for being such a shifty operative who only knows how to speak in platitudes. Either he has really bad advisors or he is not listening to good advice. He doesn't engender any confidence in his ability to govern. If he wins, we will most probably get more of the erratic policymaking and governing we saw from Hollande. There is a reason why calling him Emmanuel Hollande has been such an effective attack."

0,"Honestly I love the sound of ""anti-toil""‚Ä¶ it sounds much more descriptive, especially when thinking about hustle culture and the expectation of constant communication with those you're beholden to.

0,It's actually kind of disappointing in this case. A huge turnout and someone like Le Pen still made it this far? Yikes.
3,"&gt;  &gt;   Regardless this is not something for others to be involved in and would set a really bad precedent, we don't prosecute Fillon or Sarkozy either even though they're criminals.
&gt; 
&gt; So we agree. It's not a matter of being possible but of matter of wanting to actually do it. 

No, it's really impossible. The EU has no police force, who would arrest them? Perhaps another member state could arrest them if they left the country, but then you'd need an arrest warrant issued by, wait for it, the country they are coming from."
1,Yah that‚Äôs a good idea. I knew reddit would save me. Thank you!
1,"Hollande thinks French military interventions abroad contribute to battling terrorism. That's BS of course, but these military missions (e.g. helping the Malian regime battle jihadist rebels) don't amount to the kind of ""war"" that Hollande is talking about here. *Even* peace is under threat - he means that there is a danger of large-scale war or even WW3.

Macron hasn't gone that radical yet but many liberal parties actively defend this which is insane radicalism.

Also nice joke about saving X weeks, like most jobs don't barely pay enough to make rent and basic expenses and then only because there is a minimum wage, which guess what, radical capitalists also want to get rid of."

I mean ffs, who the hell didn't know that Obama came up under Bill Ayers and the weather underground radicals before he became senator/president? Who didn't know Bernie has been championing communism for the last 40 years?"
1,"I'm not even sure leftists would have voted for him, maybe even vote for Le Pen, betting that the ""legislatives"" would create an opposing majority, and that would prevent her from doing anything.

He's incredibly hated by everyone, because during his campaign, he based his speeches on his honesty and ability to heal the country, and that's precisely when he got suspected of stealing public money with fake jobs for his family."

I'm not denying anything, but having 'gay' figures, even if they aren't, in an anti-Muslim party can be just a way to attract voters. 

Why do you think Le Pen is surrounded by women in the pictures you see? Likely to push the narrative of a president woman an attract female voters."

0,French elections are in 2 parts. So in the second round only yhe 2 best candidates continue and thus the choice is reduced . While le pen does have high fidelity among her voters she has got a lower possible voters then just about everyone else. Meaning she is very weak for a second round.

These guys might have little dicks, or big dicks, or (statistically by far the most likely:) average-sized dicks. The most crucial fact is that they ARE dicks."

The main fear that Fillon and Le Pen would have right now is how this will affect their chances in the election.

the transition is gonna be throught politics and quite soft, since muslim and other minorities as such are gonna represent a larger part of the population, therefore if people (president etc ..) want to be elected, they will have to be appealing to that part of the population

And you would be wrong.

There are two FN. A northern one, and a southern one.

The new ""north"" part of the party is the one that could vote for Phillipot as they are mostly pissed off labor forces.

The southern part would never, ever vote for a gay. They were the one already voting for the father's antisemitic rant."

I keep seeing this critic on public figures who support M√©lenchon. Is it so hard to fathom your own view is also partisan and biased, and theirs is well informed, draws different conclusions from yours, and approves or at least thinks it's no big deal? Stop making out your political opponents as stupid or ignorant and combat them as the sensible people they are that simply follow a different logic."

We're really talking about ""the great replacement"" in France which is not about race but about culture. A historically liberal, secular, tolerant and artistically-flourishing state is importing some staid, conservative religious cultures and a clash is inevitable.

Immigration, sure. But to the level of wholesale demographic upheaval and tossing European culture to minority status?

No thanks -- and Le Pen is representing that feeling."

0,"I think this has more to do with Germany and France saying they don't need the U.S. anymore to fight these battles, that they will do this, that they will defend people if need be.  It's no accident that Macron has said this so closely to Merkel declaring that Europe can no longer rely on Trump's America."

He's a conservative, sure, but conservative views are valid political views to have. If people don't want that kind of a conservative, they'll vote against him, if they do want him, they'll vote for him. But it's still politics as usual either way. Le Pen is something else entirely. "

0,"The claim she has this phony allergy is in fact, an issue about race and xenophobia. You cannot extricate the false claims of MSG ""insensitivity"" or ""allergy"" from its xenophobia, ignorance, and racism. Informed people have known this for decades.

0,"My job allows us to sit ""if there's nothing else to do"". There is always more to do"
4," What are you even talking about? Are you talking about the Nazis or FN? If you really are comparing Hitler's Germany to Le Pen that's very fucking dishonest and disrespectful towards all of the victims of nazism.
 
 In your mind, all populist/right win parties are the same?"
0,I didn't even know what SNL was until my twenties. Mad TV was my shit.
0,"Not surprised that Britain and Israel supported, but a bit surprised that France, Italy and Germany all did. Germany and Italy haven't supported recent American military actions, and Merkel/Hollande and Trump aren't terribly close, to say the least."
0,"I think the point wasn't meant to be taken literally, and was just alluding to the fact that Le Pens father, and many of the founding members of the National Front party are holocaust deniers. Le Pen tried to transform the party from being neo-nazi into being more mainstream and modern but people still cite its past as sketchy. 96% of French Israelis voted for Macron. Also you could add things like nationalization of business and other of Le Pens socialist policies which are key elements of fascist economics."

0,"&gt;No, it does not negatively effect my health.

1,reasons why we need transnational unions and collective bargaining on a supranational level
1,"Yeah, Le Pen got crushed to a legendary degree by a liberal."
0,So a majority of gays vote against Le Pen and they would want to emigrate when she lost? That's /r/Le_canard level logic.
0,Well so is a marine just a imperialist shooty one
0,I haven't heard of any significant findings yet. This is likely why the leakers waited until the the media blackout. 'There's nothing to report' on the news helps Macron while 'we can't report about this' helps FN.
4,So what happens when the millions that have Muslim friends or are dependent on Muslims in some way (such as them being bosses of other people) just get a bunch of headaches because someone thought that the root of all problems was that one Muslims who owned a local shelf business ? Honestly if you think that le pen would remove all muslims from france then thats already being nazi level of brainwashed and ignorant and scary.
1,"Le Pen is not that right wing on economic policies. As far as I know, she's quite close to Geert Wilders in this regard. Who is almost left-wing on his economical agenda. (But super right-wing on cultural policy)

At least when it comes to their campaign platform. Voting behaviour is different. But the average voter does not care/know about actual voting behaviour."
4,Or she could find a partner who respects her feelings/wishes. Doesn't mean she shouldn't have a partner just because she doesn't want to get married.
3,"Not happy to see authoritarian communist purity testing on this sub. There's plenty of other leftist subs you can do your recruiting in. This is a place about being anti-work, it's not about organising for whatever problematic hierarchy you have in mind for your communist revolution."
1,"It depends on very specific things, yeah. That's culture, the exact nature of an incident, context etc. That's complicated.

But then again, Macron is strictly center, so I don't think any other party would feel anything even if the center was hit."
0,honestly surprised that Melenchon voters had a more favorable opinion than Fillon voters of Macron

1,"let's be real, Macron is the guy I tell Trudeau not to worry about"
0,"My feeling is that Macron's victory is actually a yes to EU more than anything else. 

People did not vote for him, they voted for EU because Macron was very much identified to pro-EU stance.

0,"STEM is definitely jerked off but that shit is still important. Society still needs to develop tech. Imagine new tech under socialism. If the technology was used to increase efficiency then it would decrease the amount of total labor needed increasing everyone's free time. 

I'll concede that for 99% of people you are right though lmao."
0,"And you can not even waver in that hatred, even for a moment..."
0,"The truth is Biden supporters voted for identity politics and covid. Trump supporters voted for economy, law and order and foreign policy."
1,"Melenchon is much more supportive of institutions than Le Pen and less evil, just stupid "
3,"Again, so? She‚Äôs an asshole for a lot of reasons. Her shitty parenting decisions are only a few of those reasons."
0,"I gotta agree. My friend and I were imitating WWE moves when I was 12 and somehow we broke my collarbone. His parents offered to pay the medical bills (it had to be re-broken and reset with some screws) and my dad flat out told them no, it wasn‚Äôt something intentional, we were just stupid and shit happens."

1,It‚Äôs just capitalism is a pure distillation of those bad traits
3,"Notice that the French legislative are not proportional ones and are territorial elections.
They are 2 turn elections and traditionally the extreme parties have disappointing scores as people are frightened of them.

As a result, it wouldn't be surprising that the socialist party gets way more seats than Melenchon's party."
1,We don‚Äôt need to sample small republican areas with no fraud. Just need to sample ALL of Phoenix and Tucson üòÇ
2,"It's been over four years now (not since he's been in office, but since the claims of racism started); let's face it: Trump cannot keep his opinions to himself to save his life. If he were racist, he wouldn't have been able to keep it secret this long.

At this point, claims of Trump being a racist are about as believable as claims he's a lizard person."
0,"In contrary, the timing make perfect sense if the author knows there is nothing juicy in those leaks . The pre-election blackout then prevent medias to analyze it and rumors can grow unchecked on social networks, creating a climate of suspicion that is going to profit Le Pen."
0,"&gt; Does this sub promote neoliberalism as in, the fact that markets are always right and should be deregulated and govt should not interfere at all (Reagan, Bush, Thatcher) or does this sub favour free-market with government intervention to prevent monopolies, high inequality, lack of social justice (e.g. Obama, Macron, Blair etc..)?

The second, the first is market fundamentalism and that is an extreme Libertarian/AnCap thing."

Edit: accidentally repeating myself"
1,"I am not saying it is the only way, but that is what Melenchon and his followers proposed.

And I dissagree, how is capitalism unethical? "
1,"To be honest.. how big of a deal is that? Yes I know Donalds opinion of  Le Pen, but is the election of a French banker.. another show of the financial industry taking over the world?"
0,You can see the moment when Macron questions the meaning of existence.

3,"I doubt that Le Pen will miss my support, and I am positive that she won't miss my vote.     
But I do have serious problems with the EU.  I am well aware of WW1 and WW2.  But I strongly doubt that that will happen again, at least not with those countries.  I am concerned with the EU's total lack of democracy and it's high handed condescending manner.

4,"That ""nice version"" is best. Going to into depth just creates avenues to argue and cajole. 
Short and sweet, ""I'm sorry, that's not possible, please don't contact me again.""

I do like your, ""we don't have that kind of relationship."""
0,Not if there is no possibility of release. We need to find a new balance to reduce recidivism for non-violent criminals while penalising violent ones.
0,"&gt; Not necessarily a referendum, Melenchon can pull out without referendum if ""negociations will fail""

Modifying the Constitution (which says ""France is part of the EU"") needs a 3/5 majority from the Parliament, or a simply majority at a referendum.

So I don't think anyone can just pull out if they want to."

0,Dont they just send ~~their corporate death squads~~ the police to suppress large strikes
3,"Is it? Plenty of people voted for Hillary purely because she wasn't Trump. In elections such as these we can't always vote for precisely what we want, we have to use our vote in the way that we consider best represents our views overall. For me, Fillon does not go far enough on the European Union and thus were I a Frenchman Le Pen would be getting my vote."

1,"Visual Novel/dating game with Bernanke, Obama, Clinton, Macron and Merkel as heroines."
3,"Macron is quite charismatic

He did not ""go where the win blows"", he built his movement from the ground up into what it is today (from only a year ago) 

And Macron has not been in the shadows, in fact the direct opposite of that. Since he left government and founded En Marche! He's been out there 24/7"

1,"Well, no the whole alpha-beta male thing is a crock of horseshit. But the behavior is shitty and toxic, regardless."
0,Good. He shouldnt denounce it. The right to protect yourself and your property is a cornerstone of our society and way of life.
4,"We're not like the right. We can't just do it with a shit-eating grin on our faces. We have morals based on empathy and compassion rather than self-righteous, self centred ones."
0,They have the right take. The US is obviously the entity that bears moral responsibility for this conflict.
3,"Lol thought I was on the wrong sub for a second. Couldn't agree more. I hope Trump doesn't go too far right wing with his pick, or waits like you said."
0,Eat instant ramen. Fap to Macron pics for a couple of hours. Net neutral calorie intake.
1,"While not illegal to do in public in most nations, it remains creepy and socially frowned upon. You should cease doing this. Just look and enjoy. There is plenty of content which suits your interests online which don't require your active participation."
1,Just when you thought the 2020 Democrats couldn't get any more ridiculous.
0,"OJ was found innocent of the murders by a court of a law is he innocent?

Burdick V United States clearly says that a pardon carries an imputation of guilt and is basically a confession. so yes if they accept a pardon they are saying ""I did it"""
4,"I agree with this. As someone who has been sexually assaulted, if everything you are saying is the truth then you need to forgive yourself and recognize that you are not a mistake you made 10 years ago.  Taking actions that give you a feeling of atonement can help the process (I‚Äôm talking charity work or just general goodwill), but don‚Äôt punish yourself forever for one drunk action."
0,"[Judging by the rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M%C3%A9lenchon#Anti-German_sentiment), wouldn't that be a Melenchon victory? :P"
0,Ever think about applying that logic to the armed rioters who attacked him?
0,Le Pen is directly bankrolled by Russians; there's nothing secret about it. And Trump had Russian agents running his campaign; also nothing secret about that. 
0,"I guess.  As soon as he offered the raise and you wouldn't bite, you should have politely declined. Just don't get the mileage you gained out of pushing this conversation further. 

Congrats on your new job however."
2,"Can you point me to those comments? Because I see no such thing.

I see people tired of the empty words of Merkel+Hollande. I see people done with the EU. I see people who don't want thousands upon thousands of immigrants spreading across Europe without the authorities being able to track and identify them. 

But I don't see racism, or xenophobia, or 'islamophobia'. "
0,"My daughter is 2.

4,"That's also not helpful. Sometimes we need to check what is really helpful in these situations, whilst 21 weeks may be not in the early stages, a babies chance of survival (outside the body) at this stage is low and miscarriages can still occur at this gestational age. Also, babies that have severe issues in utero can spontsneously abort. It is also common to miscarry if the mother is particulatly young."
3,"British people don't agree 

https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/07/british-press-most-right-wing-europe/

Our press is considered to have the most right wing bias in Europe, and considering we already have a somewhat conservative population relative to Europe that's big. Our left wing paper (the guardian) has been vocally against all the major left wing candidates in recent memory (Sanders, Corbyn, Melenchon).
 
Rupert Murdoch and Lord Rothermere, two notorious right wingers, control the majority (52%) of our published media. "

1,"the fact this dude is fucking 23 years old still doing this edgelord shit. just grow the fuck up ?? anyone with the ability to think should be able to tell that this behaviour is just dumb and unacceptable, and yes, it definitely makes him a bit heartless because anyone who actually cared or realized the weight of their words wouldn‚Äôt be saying it."
0,"The ‚Äúmight abuse cold medicine‚Äù one was weirdly spot on.

I definitely abuse ibuprofen due to my constant headaches and back pain resulting from work.

0,"No, but you can't trust them to stay home or to tell the truth. NTA"
0,"Yeah stick it to those globalists, Macron!

EDIT: Did I do something wrong? Is there a sub for people who are misinformed in politics and just want to joke around about shit?"

1,"If Kevin believes that dating Dustin will solve this bigotry, ask him to date Dustin.
You didn't do anything wrong OP"
0,"That's not a correct analysis. In France, older generations are skewed to the right but tend to favor parties with ""traditional"" ideologies, whereas young people tend to favor ""unorthodox"" parties, be them left or right wing.

Don't forget that Macron is not seen as a left-winger either. By french standards, he's at most ""strictly centrist"", some might say he's actually ""centre-right""."

1,"But it can‚Äôt be the exes choice because he has nothing to do with them, if OP has no contact with her family then the ex shouldn‚Äôt dictate if the children go."
0,"So Fran√ßois Bayrou is angry at Macron. Bayrou is a centrist and ran in 2007 and 2012. I like him, I think he's principle. But he's leading a dead party (modem) and wanted 100+ district from Macron. Macron gave him 40 and now Bayrou is mad. So he's airing it in front of the press and this is bad. Like it's drama, do this behind close doors lads. 

I think Macron is right not to give too much districts but god dammit negotiate better next time so the guy doesnt backstab you. Bayrou is threatening not to back Macron's list. "

0,"I had someone show me how to use the machines, she was in the booth and stepped out when I voted. This is probably the case here, unfortunately."
0,"So, theory question. What is the difference between being popul*ar* and a popul*ist?* Emmanuel Macron is riding a huge wave of public support and enthusiasm right now, championing a brand of anti-populism that has become such a runaway social upheaval that it's starting to look a little.... like populism. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the macaroon. But how can American politicians emulate En Marche's success without becoming populists themselves?"

0,She needed both a Fillon victory *and* a significant polling error. She got neither. 
1,"Fillon had very little appeal to the public at large. He was considered a walk-in because of his massive victory in the right's primaries, and the poll bump that gave him. 

However just one month later Fillon started collapsing in the polls, because people read his programme and did not like it. Tons of people didn't like his Bible-thumping either (his positions on gay marriage or like when he said ""As a Christian I think...""). Then the scandal was the nail in the coffin. 

In the end, Fillon's electorate was just a mix of old people and Catholic fundies.  "
4,"I'm lucky enough to be able to choose my situation. I live in a large city with lots of job opportunities and I have no-one depending on me so if I make a mistake, it'll only be me that suffers. However, I'm also intelligent enough to know that not everyone has the same situation. Especially now during the worst crisis in our lifetimes. Also, saying that it's a communist problem is completely misunderstanding the problem (as well as misunderstanding communism)."

Le Pen, on the other hand, is far, far-right-wing. Extremely nationalistic, almost touching xenophobic. Ant-Immigration, Anti-EU and other international contracts. "

3,Macron is teaching some nice lessons in humility here that trump is too stupid to take in.
0,"I'm not sure why they believe neoliberalism is inherently irreligious. Merkel and possibly Macron are more religious than their opponents, Trudeau and Obama are openly men of faith, and of the two most recent Republicans, Mitt Romney served as the rough equivalent of an Anglo-Catholic bishop while Donald Trump couldn't get basic details of the Bible right.

0,I was really stoned when I said that.   LOL I messed up big time with that one.
0,"You think so? I haven't been following it closely, admittedly, but I was under the impression that there was another left wing candidate whose voters mostly don't like Macron and will abstain, which could lead to a Le Pen lead."
0,"i know about the ""dementia tax"", it's a shame it didn't get reworked and stay in because its one of the biggest things that will threaten the NHS in the relatively close future, care costs for the elderly massively outweigh the amount of money they put in, same for the triple pension lock

problem is, these are key points the elderly vote for, and they always turn up, which is why noone wants to touch them"
0,"I am actually somewhat optimistic here. Just like a Trump Presidency normalized certain (awful) behaviors, a Biden Presidency will normalize different ones. At least that is my theory.

I don't think it's an accident that the Right is so very much threatened by what they call ""Political Correctness"". Social norms are very powerful."

3,"Ohio is neutral on the merits, but is very dismissive of the relief Texas is requesting.

From the Ohio brief:

‚ÄúWhat is more, the relief that Texas seeks would un- dermine a foundational premise of our federalist sys- tem: the idea that the States are sovereigns, free to govern themselves. The federal government has only those powers that the Constitution gives to it.

Those ideologies literally contradict one another. No offense dude but you aren't very smart, which is why it seems you can't provide reasons for your assertions. Do some research. "

You should look at the actual migration and secularism/Islam policies of all the candidates as well as their other policies; Trump for instance has some extremely dangerous policies on secularism, war, torture, the climate, and nuclear proliferation that are significantly overshadowed in the public discourse by those on Islam, and Le Pen would likely be a loyal stooge for him. Fillon or maybe even Macron could be possibilities for you."

3,"Are you intellectually impaired or what is the reason you cannot comprehend this. There is a law against violent images. I don't know if there is a law against incitement but regardless why are you asking the internet about this angrily instead of asking the French police or better yet ask Le Pen herself why she hasn't filed charges against the throat slit threat because you know, she's probably the one who can press charges and didn't, out of her own choice, nobody is stopping her.

The fact that he openly supports European integration arguably makes him less protectionist than any recent French presidents. Isn't 'buy European' less protectionist than 'buy French'?

0,ah all the hot emo girls back in the day.
0,"And as usual expect no one to actually talk about the leaks and instead point fingers while shrieking about how ""unfair"" they are.

Put it this way, start pointing out the actual falsehoods and I will happily upvote you.

**I for one just want to say I find it rather interesting that Macron's advisor on surveillance died on stage less than 12 hours after these leaks. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.**"
1,"1. He‚Äôs 6 years older than you. Red flag.
2. He loves you after a month and a half? Red flag
3. He wants to get married and have kids with you after a month and a half? Red flag.
4. He has problems"
3,"People were praising Venezuelan socialism until things went to shit, now they claimed ""it was not real socialism"" all of a sudden. Bernie sanders, Melenchon and many other notable politicians on the left praised Chavez and Venezuelan socialism openly.



This is not just a matter of it being a dictatorship, this is the result of socialist policies and practices, which by the way, require dictatorship. The dictatorship of the proletariat and authoritarianism are a pillar of communist theory. "
1,"\&gt;We are getting divorce, I've decided not to be in a relationship ever again.

Bruh, do some grief counseling or something. Swearing off love for life isn't healthy or sensible. Like why are you punishing yourself for someone else's mistakes? You can and will get through this. Just because she fucked up doesn't mean you should let her spoil relationships for you forever."
0,Omg I kind of want to do this to my husband now.
4,"Now imagine having undiagnosed social anxiety and being forced to piss people off, haha. üò¢"
0,"The one benefit of you guys electing Trump to be your President (again, to be *your President*) is that it's sent shockwaves to your allies that they have to distance themselves from American politics. If the EU manages to unify around Merkel, Macron and Italy's new support for integration then hopefully you guys can be pressured into signing some of this shit you expect others to sign."
0,In Phoenix we had about 100 kids hit a mall on Sunday and that's it. There has been no arrests since Sunday night.
3,If macron's supposed corruption bothers you but you support Trump I don't think you care very much about corruption.
0,Paint yourself orange and tell him you hate Mondays and see if he gets aroused
1,"do you think marx would have supported le pen? i don't think so, but then again, i am not into marx anyway."
1,He deserves much better than you and I hope your actions have alerted him to that. YTA
1,"&gt; 46‚ÑÖ arn't sure whom to vote for and a sizable share don't know if they would vote. So, I woud take the polls with a wheelbarrow of salt. 

That's pretty bad news. This really helped Trump because with undecided voters any short term event (like the FBI reopening email investigations) can have large effects. Plus the French left seems more concerning with fighting against anyone but Le Pen instead of fighting for anyone but not Le Pen."
0,"YESSSSS!!!!! I had that one, so gd funny to me, laughed every time

&amp;#x200B;

cause it would be so sad to be ugly"
4,"Yesterday, the top story in multiple subs was how Macron was cutting off access to RT because they were publishing biased, inaccurate, badly sourced news. Everyone was praising Macron for it. 

When Trump hints of anything similar in response to hit pieces, there it tremendous outrage, even amongst conservatives. In the last year and a half, the mainstream media has proved itself to be dishonest, malicious garbage. It is time conservatives realized that giving garbage access is not the defense of any great principle. And that garbage needs to be discarded and not given a helping hand. "
0,I was going to say the same. Cherish this place as your most sacred treasure! Defend it with your life! Never let it go!
1,"Lots of Dems don't really want the status quo to change, and progressives are fucking pissed, the centrists then call incivility (which they're somewhat correct on, but tbh civility is worthless to the suffering)"
0,Can't wait for the alt right tears when Le Pen loses bigly.
1,"Do you ever wonder why you feel like so many groups are against you, or why Trump adds groups/people to that list when they speak out against him? 

Do you ever stop to think that maybe it's not everyone else with a problem?"
1,She is an Islamist and wets herself thinking about islam world domination.
0,I absolutely loved that show. That and Guts. It‚Äôs funny how the hosts/captains seemed so much old to me but really they themselves were kids.
0,"You think the IRS wouldn't say anything if he wasnt paying his taxes, dumbass?"
3,"we like the LibDems... you probably agree with us on most things then

le pen at least has fascist tendencies no?"
0,"That's true, although I don't really know how that nationalist would mean in EU-nationalist context. Macron does go on and on about France, vive la republique! But he is pro-EU. 

Pechtold (d66) and Klaver (GL) also go on and on about how awesome the Netherlands is and its potential. Especially D66 seems to an optimist style. Klaver had especially large (for the Netherlands) political rallies which are a hallmark of nationalism. 

If you define nationalism only in opposition to the evil outside world than they are not nationalist. But they will contrast themselves to the non-liberal world (russia for example). "
0,"What if in a timeline to the future France elects Le Pen, which is certainly possible, goes to join Russia giving America an invite along the way before Britain can do so, and starts arguing very nationalistic French things like moving the EU headquarters out of Brussels by agitating wallonia and getting very interested in the benelux, taking claims on the border mountain regions of Spain and Italy trying to test the boundaries. What could a heavily disarmed and outgunned Europe do with no MAD option? "
0,"That's just journalists opining about ISIL strategy. I mean it is very interesting, but I still doubt that somewhere in northern Iraq their leadership is discussing how to make France elect Le Pen. They polarize,  but I don't think they have goals which are so specific as to which politician is elected."
3,"OK!

First of all, I don't see any reason to ban dual citizenship.
Second, I believe the stated policy details are a not so subtle racist dog whistle, calling to antisemitic and generally racist sentiments.
My rhetorical questions are plainly aimed at showing the hypocrisy in this policy proposal, which would arbitrarily exclude from its effect the biggest ally of Le Pen."
0,"Talk about a rock and a hard place for a global-minded leftist.  Sorry if I sound like an ignorant outsider, but do you think that those voters might end up voting Le Pen to at least preserve the welfare state despite the nationalism and EU rhetoric?"
0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/673o3e/macronle_pen_in_french_runoff/dgnzk3k/

Told ya.

&gt;I doubt Le Pen will win. She needs to magic up like 30 more points in the election from.. somewhere.

She did, indeed, lose by 30 points."
1,"I don't actually believe you, but I'll formulate my response as if you are.

Your opinion on Macron or Trump means exactly nothing, by posting what you do, you help the opposition by driving that wedge inbetween parties. You are helping the cause you hate."
4,"I think hiding things on social media is a significant problem. Thats usually associated with cheating, the only reason many are dismissing it is this wife of his is almost immobile. But even so if you're hiding anything from your significant other then it simply isn't an honest relationship."
0,"Somewhere in there is a step where you use a resume template website to create a resume but when you get to the end it doesn't give you a downloadable one, it asks for your email and says you have to pay for the monthly service to get it. And if you do get it, it's just a PDF of the resume where the text can't be copied/pasted from."
0,"It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs being obnoxious, she‚Äôs walking. This is so incredibly petty my god. YTA."
0,"The french politic-cast... we need such a deep reform about it. No more ENA to start with... but that's a different topic.

Anyway, Fillon, Valls... they both stand a fair chance. I'm somewhat of an optimist and refuse to believe my people would be dumb enough to elect a fascist. Then again, 2016 has been full of unforeseen political surprises. 

"
1,"Yeah why are so many conservatives on here naive as fuck? The Dems aren‚Äôt stupid, they are doing this on purpose. None of it is an accident from withholding the footage to overcharging the officers.

The video was leaked, we were never supposed to see it. These people want the country destroyed and under their control. Wake the fuck up, this will never stop, rolling over and making ‚Äúit‚Äôs just them‚Äù excuses will get us all fucked.

They control what is being taught to our kids and they control the media and continue spoon feeding them as adults."
0,"Stfu

Everyone knows that society would collapse without salt-of-the-earth financial analysts"
3,But it's not because of her euroscepticism that they don't vote for Le Pen. It's more likely because they hate her love for the police and her religious undertone.
1,"Would be swell if your parties got their heads out of their asses, Macron is pathetic and weak through and through."
1,"Correct me if i'm wrong

Le Pen - super-racist nationalist

Macron - bankster

Fillon - regular racist nationalist

Hamon - the sane leftist

Melenchon - the insane leftist

0,"Goodness, just tell me who my president is going to be. Wow."
0,Hand delivered letters come with a verbal message along with zero chance of being leaked by some POS Army Major looking to score points. All countries do this.
0,It's really something to how obvious the entire game was and continues to be. It's just refreshing to hear someone who was boots on ground say it.
0,"So far Trump is getting glowing reviews from Nigel Farage, Marine Le Pen, Vladimir Putin, Erdogan, Duterte and pretty much every other wannabe despot in power. Maybe North Korea will get along with him too."
1,"&gt; The idea of having to vote between Le Pen and M√©lenchon is frankly super frightening for a lot of French people.

The idea of the French people having to vote between Le Pen and M√©lenchon is super frightening for the rest of us as well, trust me on this."
0,"Imagine being a conservative in America and calling someone else an authoritarian.  We just saw a mob, incited by the authoritarian in chief, try to overturn an election, and you are here whining about respecting the constitution.  Ted Cruz, is that you?"

I vote for le Pen but i wish him good luck 43% of the ppl who voted for him didnt like him.

1,"There's the problem. You're NOT acting dignified, you're acting delusional. Nobody is against you, they merely disagree with you and have offered advice on what you should do. You refuse to listen, insisting that everyone is wrong while defending your shit behavior. I stand by my comment."
4,"Lol get out of here with this clownery. Please be nicer daughter; im too scared to lose you.

If you love your kid, you'll do whats best for her (not letting her get away with entitled and childish behavior). It is her choice to destory their relationship not his. Your solution is a non solution dressed up in feel good psychology (am a psychology undergrad so I'm not clueless in human interaction)"

4,Accept the gift. Tell him how much you appreciate what he‚Äôs done for you. That‚Äôs all.
0,"I'd say the substantial difference was in what the hackers found in the e-mails. In the DNC case it was a lot of evidence that the ""Democratic"" party was not working democratically at all. So they've released it with enough time for the media to absorb that. That's why it had an impact.  

In Macron's case they found nothing so they released it after media blackout to deny the news outlets issuing a collective groan about the matter. There was just nothing to generate an impact from.  "
3,ESH. Look I get that you are angry but hindsight is 20/20 and they were told by a doctor that you were fine. You can‚Äôt be angry with them for trusting the doctor.
1," I think you may be confused as to the nature of neoliberalism. The sidebar has a lots of information explaining things. 

We're not communists or further left than Blair/Clinton/Keating/Obama/Macron, we dislike Sanders/Corbyn/Stein/Maduro as much as we loathe Trumpistanis.

"
0,"Those polls are obviously biased and not at all evidence-based. Show me some evidence-based, properly neoliberal polls and then I'll believe you.

I mean to unjerk exactly one level what do you think renouvellement politique and Son programme mean except a bunch of people supporting Macron's policies? Clearly France is a bunch of R1ing lanyard nerds and neoliberalism is the glorious future."
1,"when I was a kid my dad use to tell me how he had to keep his jewishness a secret in the south because of white supremacist. I always thought it was absurd. now that the fucking president can't even denounce white supremacist, I have the same feelings as my dad did. sad how we are going backwards."
1,"Hollande had a weaker domestic position.  He wasn't able to be the public face of the EU in taking unpopular policies.

I don't think that the amount that they show up necessarily reflects the actual relative influence that each country has.

Don't get me wrong.  I think that having either Hollande or Merkel doing that was a bad idea.  Should gave been Juncker or Tusk or whoever always being the public face, even if internally, all the decisions were made by country-level politicians.  Makes people feel represented."
0,"There is a French, somewhere, saying the exact same thing about Le Pen."
1,"So in Brittany, where Le Pen was pelted with eggs."
3,"You don't even need to change the EC, just have every state change the way they award electors based on the porportional vote instead of what it is now with ""winner take all.""

The states themselves are the problem. They created an arms race in order to feel important, and now nobody wants to deescalate because doing so would tip the scales too much in one direction."

0,"We are already there if you count even 50% of the 300,000+ excess deaths (number as of Oct 23rd)... given that so many COVID cases go unnoticed but still invade our cells, it seems very likely they are related. My grandpa-in-law got COVID (he is 99) and seemed fine...well 2 months later he has kidney failure. Could it have happened anyway? Yeah. Does it seem very coincidental? Most definitely."
4,Im already in that sub...tho when i read the stories i always end up feeling like im not abused enough to be there...
0,Or Adio for that matter. I used to love those.
0,I stopped applying for jobs like this too. I figure if enough people refuse to work maybe the bad companies will finally realize they can't get away with treating everyone like chattel. I love to tell my friends where NOT to apply.
0,It will affect the vote. But probably not the way you think. Macron is the victim of a global cyber attack and they won't have time to find anything compromising. He's going to appear like a victim.
0,Maybe to find out more about what the job entailed to see if she was up to the task? Job interviews aren't just for employers to ask the questions.
1,Although some of her treatment of her sister is pretty calculated and evil. There‚Äôs more to that story since Jade has such mean tendencies.
0,"The second place winner at my *bureau de vote* was Monsieur V. Blanc.  I hear he ran a good campaign.  (Seriously, though, our totals were 80% Macron, 10% Blanc/Nul, and 10% Le Pen. Le Pen's % did not increase relative to the *premier tour* (""primary"") but Blanc's % did. This is in Paris so it shouldn't be too surprising.)"
0,"ah, probably yes, I feel like it'd be better than trying to communicate but colliding with his ""nothing happened it's all FINE"" attitude"
0,"I think Macron is the best because he actually understands contemporary economics. Contrary to general opinion, mainstream econ is very syncretic and ready to assist people. If anyone is going to prevent him from actually improving the society, it will be the French parliament pandering to voters."
0,"Don't want to vote for Biden? Don't vote for him. 

But also don't skew this into some crap that it isn't. Unlike all of the bullshittery of trump."
0,"""Hope"", ""Change"" and ""Yes We Can"" worked quite well last time with Barry O. As Macron has proved again, positive messages go a long way."
0,"I hate both parties too, but I hate each of them for very different reasons.  I hate the Republicans for constantly fucking over the majority to benefit the extreme minority, attempting to destroy democracy, and controlling their supporters with disinformation campaigns (buttery males, Benghazi, Birther, Pizzagate) and I hate the Democrats for being so incredibly incompetent that they seem to let it happen."
0,I just watched /r/Le_Pen what is that post about Macron having a bank(?) about? 
3,"&gt;	I mean, what is stopping Trump from declaring an emergency and suspending elections? 

That‚Äôs not really how this works. Elections are handled at the state level. Trump can try to cancel the elections,  but he has no mechanism for enforcing this. Short of deploying the military, to bar people from the polls, there is no mechanism by which the POTUS can just stop elections from happening."
4,People just love to abuse and ignore those that they deem below them.. its sickening
0,I like how calling it a circus is low key calling  Trump a clown.
0,Biden has no reason to accept.  It's just painfully obvious.
1,Any French people able to explain why the North East is more supportive of Le Pen than the rest of the country? 
0,I liked Beakman because it had a female scientist teacher too.
0,"Actually....we love being sent overseas for any reason. When I joined, I was deciding between two jobs. Recruiter said ‚Äúif you choose job A, you get a 10k bonus. If you choose job B, you get no bonus and the unit you‚Äôll be assigned to is deploying soon after you get done with basic‚Äù so I chose job B, talking to a bunch of my friends, they chose the same job because they wanted to deploy and actually DO their job."
0,"My dude, that‚Äôs literally the definition of shallow. There‚Äôs nothing deep or complex about it= shallow. Simple people like simple things."
0,"Le Pen wants a outright Frexit.

M√©lenchon wants the treaties to ease up on mandatory austerity to allow more economic freedom to countries. If other countries don't even want to talk, he's in favor of Frexit. If they do want to talk, the result of negotiations will be left to a referendum: whatever change he could negotiate or Frexit."
1,"They shit on him when he ran for president, calling him everything from racist to elderly mass murderer and here he is going ass to mouth sucking every turd out of Chuck Schumer‚Äôs rear end."
1,"Holy shit, a memory I didn‚Äôt even know I had..."
0,"Melenchon is not a communist althought communist movements support him because he is the most leftist candidate. As far as I know he is not planning to ~~cease~~ seize the means of production. He is also not planning to do something like one-party government, something that is seen as ""communist"" but really isn't (communism wants a classless society without the state). Our world moved to economical right so much that a guy saying we should put interests of the people before corporations is called a communist..."
0,Reading theguardians summary to the debate some of le pen's answers to some of the questions from the debate moderators made me want to facepalm. 
0,"I....don't have a problem with this?

I think the social security thing is a bit stupid but obviously there needs to be an oversight committee and f* stock buybacks. f* Boeing specifically. It's insane they took out so much debt just to facilitate stock buybacks to get themselves richer. I'd never support giving them more money so that they can just pay themselves."

1,"I don't get the no pressure argument. If someone robs a Bank but the teller doesn't realize that they're robbing the bank and they report afterwards it seemed like everything was fine but it turns out that they actually did lose millions of dollars in a robbery, then it doesn't really matter that that teller felt no pressure."

0,"I think it will be there in about 2-3 months.

If you watch some news clips about Wuhan, reporters go around asking patients how much they've paid for their hospital stay, or the food their served, etc. They haven't paid a cent, and won't have to.

Contrast that to the upstanding guy in Florida who got tested at the ER and now owes $3,200, just for trying to do the right thing.

Once this happens to tens of thousands of people... Well I hope we'll wake up"
4,"I think these things can go either one of two ways.

Either whites will be in this constant state of self-flagillation, which in a weird way scars their collective psyche. Which leads to a pretty nasty hatred of one self - which I see nothing positive with.

Or it can go the other way - and that can be really nasty."

They should be promoting abortion."

1,"Unfortunately, a similar mentality exists here in Canada too. The people who voted for Harper didn't care about his Saudi Arms deals as long as he banned the hijab. Thankfully, he lost, but even our new government is engaging in those same deals

Even in France, Le Pen voters did not care about her Russian connection as long as she stopped immigration. Thankfully she lost too.

The years they spent demonising anything and anyone to their left, the propaganda they push in conservative media and the hatred they have cultivated for their perceived enemies, all of that could only have one outcome, the rise of populist authoritarian. And the Republicans who actually have power have stayed complicit and silent with every new outrage. After this election, assuming we oust Trump, you can bet they will want to continue business as usual pretending they didn‚Äôt just bring our democracy to the precipice."
1,"I'd go for a cuddle party between me, Macron, and Merkel "
0,"&gt;I said voting for Le pen is not the most pro-democratic move

Voting isn't pro-democracy. Voting. Isn't. Pro-democracy.

Do you people realize that democracy doesn't just mean whatever you want it to mean?

&gt;The overwhelming implication of this election is Le Pen, anti-EU, the secession of France from which would upend the western democratic order, and Macron, who is obviously very pro-EU, which is the greatest contribution to European democracy and peace in world history.

This is arrogant to a ludicrous degree."

0,"It really doesn't matter what you think of Trump, but in the past year, Hollande has told the U.S. how to manage its climate policy, how to manage the situation in Syria, told the U.S. how to manage the Cuba embargo, encouraged people to vote for Hillary, criticized Obama.

1,I have a feeling the good cops are going to start leaving and finding different jobs. This is going to cause departments to quickly hire new people with less funding. Which means they won‚Äôt be as trained. Also mean departments will probably lower there standards when hiring. Putting more ‚Äúbad‚Äù cops on the force. Things might get worst
1,"&gt; Oh well, France without Le Pen is in for a rough five years. How many more police will be shot? How many ""trucks of peace"" will visit? How many more riots and car burnings will there be? How far will the no-go zones expand? Will the rest of Paris be swallowed up by people living on the streets?

It looks like they split down the middle, but most of those who didn't want Macron abstained instead of supporting Le Pen.

The best chance of winning is someone who can consolidate and communicate your message the best. Both the progressive left and the center could win the primary, it'll just be whoever develop the stronger message.

If you want a centrist to win the Democratic nomination, find one who can get through to the people the most like Macron did in France.

They pretend to be obsessed with race and gender and sexual orientation, but they magically stop caring about any of those things the moment that they discover that someone has the wrong ideology. The lefts pretense of obsession with race, gender and sexuality is only a tool to use to divide society to bring about their Marxist dystopia and too many conservatives fall for the distraction and take their eyes off of the lefts real goal."

0,"Not a well executed debate. Trump did okay, Biden was not very convincing or genuine. Trump kept taking Biden‚Äôs bait rather than hammer the issues and accomplishments. I feel like any person on this subreddit could have beaten Biden better than Trump did."

Healthy and affordable - make it yourself (ie: meal prep)"

2. The polls above provide reinforcing information, in that there are multiple polls with the same result."

1,"Fewer than 300 killed in terror attacks in France in the last two decades. Experts on terrorism and psychology around the globe agree that a culture of xenophobia makes terrorism worse, not better.

Those like Le Pen are demonstrably bad choices if the outcome you desire is to lessen terrorism. Good luck with another 5 years of trying to actively avoid learning about anything having to do with the complexities of any of these issues and pretending that just being angry and hateful at people will do any good."

I only talked about Le Pen, I said that people that are not conservative can vote for her, and that being anti-EU, anti-immigration, isn't taken into account for these votes. You need to better undertand the FN votes. If you only want to talk about conservative values, Fillon is more on the line with Marion MLP than with Marine LP."
1,"People like you are the reason why the far right is gaining momentum. If people can't talk about immigration reforms without being labeled racists then the pathway for discussion closes and groups polarize.

Why do you say this? He did not have the backing of parliament. It's the reason he had to impose it via decree. It's the reason he would not submit it to a vote.

If anything, it proved that Macron would not accept such scandal among his ministers and wants a very clean government. It was one of his main political promises and it means he's serious about that. I think it will do more good than harm for him.

There is absolutely no chance this interview is related to that."

With the other 50% either abstaining (majority) and a smaller voting for Le Pen.

&gt; Please explain how this helped Le Pen: 'Factually a lift gotten from'

Every non-vote doesn't count, increasing the representative percentage of every candidate ergo Le Pen got bigger numbers than she really represents. (Goes for Macron too though). It artificially lifted her result, thus the article is correct.

Melenchon voters are target because Melenchon didn't follow tradition. Actions have consequences."

1," &gt; Also both candidates are very bad for the EU and Europe in general.


Melenchon wants to *reform* the EU to make it less liberal and more democratic. Isn't that exactly what it needs? Or are you saying the EU is perfect? Plus such reforms would significantly reduce the impact of far-right anti-EU parties. "

2,"Hmmm, most of the towns I'm thinking of are very industrial and very working class.  
Probably there is a strong presence of organized labour and politicized workers who are voting for M√©lenchon. There'd also be a history of strong communist local government. There wouldn't be so many privileged kids.

Paris is an interesting case - the wealthiest neighbourhoods have voted Fillon, the more middle class ones Macron, and the more working class ones (19th, 20th) have voted M√©lenchon."

The problem is Trump would need to embrace a united Europe rhetoric but if he keeps supporting crazy people like Le Pen so yeah."
0,"It is important to note that AfD have been losing their voting share, and that in Germany the two main candidates are both European Federalists: Merkel and Schulz.

In France Macron has been gaining a larger and larger lead over Fillon, and vs Le Pen in the second round looks to win by about 20%.

Furthermore Wilders is not even polling first anymore, and nobody will form a coalition with him anyway.

1,"French here. The only way she could win are :

* There is a terrorist attack before the election.

* She is on the second round against M√©lenchon.

If there is no terrorist attack, then she could go to the second round, however all the other vote will go for her opponent.

If she is against Melenchon then were are fucked either way, but he is the lesser evil, even if their program have a lot of similarties.

In 2002 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_French_presidential_election,_2002) Le Pen (her father) was underestimated by 3% which was a shock back then, but still. 3% are not that much.

The reason for the 22,23 % not voting does ultimately not matter. The point is however that none of them supported Macron or Le Pen either.

0,"&gt; I am not American and therefore don't know Susan Collins or Collin Peterson but I think that Macron is too centrist to be compared with Chris Christie.

I think his comparison is valid in the American context, in that somebody like Christie is one of the more left-leaning Republicans, which puts him somewhat close to the American political center. It is a far more apt comparison than a Clinton endorsement, as she is left her party's center, which makes her measurably further from the American political center. "

Those are pretty different approaches."
0,"Polling yesterday put Macron ~25 points ahead (~63-38), and here we see turnout 6% below 2012 (72%) and 10% below 2007 (75%). Let's say every single person who didn't show up to vote leaned toward Macron, so he loses **all** the votes due to low turnout. About a tenth (10%) to a seventh (14%) of the electorate is gone, all from Macron here, and so his 63% estimate drops down to (63-10)/90 = **58%** or (63-14)/86 = **57%.**

So Macron should *still* be estimated as a double-digit favorite in the absolute worst-case scenario for him here."

0,"I always voted for Macron but had some sympathies for Le Pen; Then came the second turn debate: All that agressivity... out of one hour of talk time she honestly presented her program maybe 10 minutes, the rest was for trashing her opponent. It was just uncomfortable to watch. It also showed a new face of Macron: the babyface, Mr Perfect Macron could definitely hold his own in an extremely hostile environnement and actually win."

0,It's oddly comforting to hear how invested our international friends are in watching this. It's kinda validating to have the world acknowledge just how crazy this is. Living it is... surreal.
0,"It doesn't mean they'll vote for her. It's pessimism, i.e. ""he played the good boy role, she played the anti-system, no bullshit, close to the people role, she did better to convince new voters"" because those voters hate what Macron represents, so they only see worth in the other posture."
2,"Because he sees it from his perspective. 

His title is ""These three frenchmen celebrating Macron's win"" will trigger right wingers because those 2 Black men aren't ""French"" in their eyes.  I maybe reading more into it than usual but notice that the 2 Black men outnumber the 1 White man, which conveys that the White population is being overrun."

Can't we do as we use to do... wait and see what the justice as to say?"
1,"Sounds like a good summary :)

A lot of him see him as a symbol of Neoliberal Globalisation and Uberisation, and of smirky born-rich kids, and so really don't like him. I wouldn't call him Obama-tier popular, he does derive a significant number of votes from people who mostly hate Le Pen more."

0,"The weirdest thing here is timing. We don't have that many elections coming up soon. So the real question is in like a year and a half, what will happen? Macron, May's Folly and Austria all were post-Trump elections that fired up the moderates and left. We'll see how everyone is feeling next year, basically."

That is not how France works. Abstention in this case means they'll take it to the streets. 'wait and see' isn't really a thing in a country where unions start to strike *before* the negotiations start. 

Macron's mandate is nominally strong (which is basically owed to the system), but socially not stronger than Hollande's. "

2,"Not supporting Macron ‚â† Not being anti-fascist.

For example, I can not support Macron, nor support Le Pen because my left-wing political ideas are incompatible with Macron's socio-(neo?)liberalism and the Far-right.

Anyway, FN is not a fascist party. It's a far-right party, but not fascist. It's a different phenomenon, IMO. We don't live in the XX century anymore. I think we shouldn't‚Äã use labels from the past to refer to new phenomena, although it's Far-right.

His platform includes cutting corporate tax and gov't spending, though. He's also a really big fan of the EU, which is (in part) a massive free trade area. 

There's good info in the sidebar (and in the sistersub /r/globalistshills) but basically this sub occupies the center economically. So there's a lot of candidates from ""socialist"" parties we're not fans of, and we're definitely not fans of actual Marxist thought. "

* As a society, we're going to have to agree on some kind of ""internet amnesty"" for stupid shit that people do/say online in the not-recent past. Can you imagine if Ossof or Macron had a bunch of edgy memes on their Zynga accounts?"
0,I fail to see how that would work considering the cornerstone of fascism is nationalism. Fascists are notoriously anti-EU like Le Pen since the EU is highly multi-cultural.
0,"The last couple of days have seriously given me the feeling that Macron is going to end up being regarded on a level with, say, de Gaulle as one of the great politicians in modern history once things are said and done.

1,"Careful, the Democrats would not have been able to prevent Bernie Sanders from running. I gather it became unpopular on Reddit to mention him or imply he had a chance, but it's our strict two party system that prevents candidates like him from running in the general. Someone like Macron could not even have a career in the US. "
0,"Firstly, thank mr macron


Secondly, regarding the ""What is Neoliberalism"" bit of the sidebar, I feel like ""For instance, Neoliberals advocate lowering barriers on trade and immigration while also supporting a price on carbon emissions,"" would read better than ""Neoliberals therefore advocate lowering barriers on trade and immigration while also supporting a price on carbon emissions."" 

The way it is now essentially implies that those are the only three policy initiatives that Neoliberals advocate, while the improvement elaborates on what's in the preceding sentences. 


Thirdly, thank mr macron.

2,"&gt;She must think people are really fucking stupid though.

The internet toolkit -- call it Russian, alt-right or by any other name -- is far from a superweapon. It's merely a collection of dirty techniques based on modern delivery methods. These methods are not a silver bullet. A country with a healthy political culture and engaged voters can reject them.

1,"I don't quite agree. Realizing what makes individuals (who combine to make the system) accept their domination is key to dismantling it. The solution imo isnt a traditional revolutionary socialist state, but a weakened and modified capitalism where nobody is forced into wage slavery to live.

I won't pretend for a second that the far left is nearly as dangerous as the far right, in the current political climate.

If Le Pen gets elected there will be people whose lives are suddenly cast into fear and terror (think children of illegal immigrants crying on election night, but worse). If melenchon gets elected, Frances economy may go into the dump but nobody has to fear for their lives."

0,"She's trying not to associate with him politically/in public for reputation purposes. That doesn't meant they don't still care for eachother. Enough to help out monetarily and to accept that help, at least.

This makes sense because France isn't very religious in the first place. So to appeal to the majority politicians usually avoid to be perceived as religious."

1,This is the reaction people have to this behavior. He needs to see how it is. Its not like people are telling the kid to eat shit and die or anything.

The guy was an unhinged maniac who publicly picked on refugees for fun."

1,"&gt; but let's be serious his biggest advantage is that he isn't Le Pen

That's been pretty debunked by victories in the legislative elections. If voters wanted anything other than Macron, or even a Macron with a check on his agenda, they could have voted against him. Instead he will win the biggest majority since De Gaulle. Shows French voters want him, and his agenda to, not just as a ""least worst option"" but as a first choice."

1,"Nothing to do with him. It's a (small) scandal for the Modem party (Fran√ßois Bayrou party) who was a political ally for Macron. Macron never was a member of this party or affiliated to this story.

If anything, it proved that Macron would not accept such scandal among his ministers and wants a very clean government. It was one of his main political promises and it means he's serious about that. I think it will do more good than harm for him.

IMO Le Pen and Macron will make it past the first round and then Le Pen will lose by a massive margin in the second round.

Obviously the French should take the threat seriously but there isn't any point in fearmongering.

Don't be valuephobic, muh Poland. See the bigger peaceful picture. Macron's ego. Kabooms of peace. Peace all around."

2,But they were born in France...to recent immigrants who practice Islam. Do you think the Le Pen voters would have the same opinion about people such as Japanese immigrants? I highly doubt it. To pretend this is just about immigration alone is ridiculous. It's about immigration of groups of people who have values and a culture that leads to problems integrating and social unrest. 
2,"More to the point, xenophobia in France greatly predates the recent rash of terrorism there. The National Front first attracted international concern when Marine Le Pen's father progressed to the second round in the 2002 election. I'm not very familiar with their rhetoric but I'm willing to bet terrorism is only a small part of it."

0,"Russia is  more than relevant to us. Putin is opposed to the neoliberal western order. That's why he blatantly opposed Merkel, Clinton and Macron. "
0,"What worries me is that Macron has to deliver. If he disappoints just like Hollande did, Le Pen will have carte blanche to push a Frexit through and lead Europe down a very bad path. So, on one side I am happy for Macron, on the other I am concerned - he better deliver."

For McConnel the senate was basically raped lol"
4,"That‚Äôs a bit shitty. I had a similar number to the local cinema for years so I used to print out the timings each week and keep them by the phone because I quite enjoyed helping and sometimes it was quicker than a confused conversation about what number they called vs what they should have called. 

It‚Äôs not nice to be mean to people. It‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt it on purpose."

0,This is a perfect example of someone not understanding what socialism means.
0,"I think it's a pragmatic measure.

Aside from young people, the population is rather in favor of drug ban. This half-measure allows:

-To reallocate ressources/policemen/judges/prison for important matters.

-A compromise that won't divide French society and won't make Macron unpopular. Hollande¬¥s reform for gay marriage made radical Catholics angry and they went on demonstrations for weeks. Macron has no time to spend on this and has more important things like economic reforms or moralisation of French politics (there wasn't a week we didn't heard of a corruption of embezzlement scandal during the presidential election)

0,"Lol, the ""globalism"" originated in the classical liberals' revolutions in the mid-1800s as an option for mercantilism. Since then every mainstream economic theory has advocated free trade; including Keynesians, Friedman/Chicago boys, and Austrian economics. It's mainly far leftists and now the nationalist right who have opposed it (in some countries, for example Le Pen and Trump are isolationists but Farage wants more free trade).

Plus, the mainstream EU parties are the center right who are hardcore neoliberals. Neoliberalism is the unholy union between Keynes and Friedman."

0,They both suck. I'm really tired of conservatives acting like we have anything in common with Le Pen and her party. She pushes big government policies while making idiotic statements downplaying France's role in the Holocaust. She's basically a member of the alt-right.

And doubtless, when Macron wins, rather than respecting French voters decision they will screech about rigging and coward French destroying their society. "

I've thought that but a few conversations with free food have changed my mind on it - a financial transaction tax combined with potentially losing passporting will annihilate one of our major industries, for no reason.

It might lead us to a Macron/en marche-style movement forming in the long term but it's equally possible things will just suck for extended period of time"
0,"If I was a betting man, I'd make some money on suckers betting on Le Pen.

3,"It seems that no one wants to admit that there are some serious, fundamental problems that people are having with current political direction of the West. It's easy to say that every brit who voted for Brexit was dumb, that every American who voted for Trump was dumb, and that every frenchmen that votes for Le Pen is dumb.. This doesn't highlight the stupidity of people, it highlights that a majority of the population in a democratic nation fundamentally disagree with it's current political administration. "
0,"Let me see if i understand this.

Le Pen tweeted violent imagery from ISIS 2 years ago. That was interpreted as incitement, but she had immunity so they couldn't do anything. Now that she's running they repealed that immunity so that they can prosecute her for a tweet of someone else doing something violent. And reddit is cheering for this?

If his government can't then there will probably be an increase in support for the FN as well as La France insoumise(Melenchon's party). The main support for Le Pen and Melenchon came from people who are upset about France's economic troubles so if that continues then the support will continue and probably grow."

0,A certainly interesting development. Now left and centrist voters in France need to create a strategy for the First Round - having Fillon and Le Pen advance to Round 2 by dividing into numerous small parties is not ideal from their point of view. Getting behind Macron might be the best strategy for a French center and center-left; while the French right should probably hope that these forces do not consolidate and that two conservatives manage to advance.

There's good info in the sidebar (and in the sistersub /r/globalistshills) but basically this sub occupies the center economically. So there's a lot of candidates from ""socialist"" parties we're not fans of, and we're definitely not fans of actual Marxist thought. "

In France, social services are good, but the economy is moribund, unemployment is high, and the bureaucracy is swollen and inefficient.

0,"It's perfectly valid answer. I don't need to go in depth into refugee camp management just to make simple point about her probable motives.

Meanwhile you completely ignored my question and went with this convoluted reasoning. You need to get this idea out of your head, that everything happens with a purpose to advance or hurt some cause. Most people or organisations act on simple pragmatic or self-interested reasons.

By the way have you bothered to read some reports or do you just believe what politicians like Le Pen tell you?"

But in Obama's case, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff traits heavily outweight his Slytherin traits so it's not really worth mentioning, Trump is a stupid kind of ambitious which erodes the effectiveness of his Slytherin traits (i.e. I don't count failing upwards as legitimate ambition), and Macron is for the memes and is not too serious an evaluation."

0,"The whole anti-EU movement started with the financial crisis, but really amped up with the migrant crisis and social media propaganda and shitposting which amplified it.

Macron realizes this I think, and if he can cobble together a European strategy to reinforce the external borders and take other measures to reduce migration, then the whole nationalist extremist movement can be effectively deflated to its pre-2015 levels.

Then its a matter of dealing with the financial issues which can possibly be solved with a common budget, tax harmonization and fiscal transfers, if some proper mechanisms and rules are developed."

1, Speaking of anonymous tweeters it turned out Le pen has a fake twitter to anonymously use. The @ is @enimar68 which is her birth year and the word marine with the letters moved around. And the name is her middle name and her moms maiden name. Pretty weak disguise.

1,"What's anyone going to do to him? No one is going to invade and the countries he's trying to interfere with are already sanctioning Russia.

Not to mention Putin is probably betting on democracies having a short enough attention span that whoever comes in after Trump and (maybe) Le Pen will be promising to help people with their student loans or their mortgages instead of paying attention to Russia."
1,Which means that Le Pen not only lost. She came in 3rd. In a competition between two people. That has to be some kind of achievement :D
0,"&gt; Shy Le Pen voters could be a thing

Then again, the last 4 elections in France have had an average error of 0, but a huge average absolute error.

Unfortunately for the foreign agents, this would have meant that Macron could have defended himself and reporters could have revealed that the emails have been doctored.

By releasing this info ""too late"" the only people spreading it are random folks on social media and conspiracy sites. Which is better for these Alt-right agents as people are less likely to find out how much of this is fake until after the elections."

There's still an election to come to determine the rest of the government, and the seats could be taken up by factions not friendly to Macron, which means he could end up with a PM (who determines the cabinet) not friendly to him.

Dunno!"

That's not saying we should stop the migrants however. I'm just saying that people should attempt to accept Muslims, which will lead to cultural assimilation. Cutting off further immigration from the middle east is actually imperative to making Frenchmen out of the immigrants."

During the last decade, the government he is part of as well as his european political family in general has been the dominant force in EU politics. We've seen them partner with both Sarkozy and Hollande. And nothing changed.

The positive about capitalism is innovation and economic growth.

But capitalism needs curtailing, to prevent monopolies, to protect democracies, to safeguard human rights, to ensure that the largest group benefits.

But It doesn‚Äôt mean that innovation is not rewarded.

0,"Polling yesterday put Macron ~25 points ahead (~63-38), and here we see turnout 6% below 2012 (72%) and 10% below 2007 (75%). Let's say every single person who didn't show up to vote leaned toward Macron, so he loses **all** the votes due to low turnout. About a tenth (10%) to a seventh (14%) of the electorate is gone, all from Macron here, and so his 63% estimate drops down to (63-10)/90 = **58%** or (63-14)/86 = **57%.**

So Macron should *still* be estimated as a double-digit favorite in the absolute worst-case scenario for him here."
1,"&gt; He **basically** said 'all women are used up wh\*res living paycheck to paycheck' and made some other really ugly, prejudiced, over-generalized comments.

1,"While that's true of their leaks, they pushed links to the false macron leaks, and they have recklessly released personally identifiable information like in the 'Erdogan emails'. 

The organization has linked to the_donald on social media, have refused to criticize Putin, and have even go so far as to condemn the Panama Papers as anti-Putin propaganda. Wikileaks has also propped up conspiracy theories like pizzagate and 'spirit cooking' on social media. Saying they're unbiased because their leaks are genuine is misleading."

2,"Having a difference in opinion is okay for things like...pizza toppings. Not racism. 

If you're okay with your friends being dicks to Asians or black people or whatever race, then you're racist too. You don't get to disconnect from that, like ""oh but they attended the KKK rally at *lunch* but I'm meeting them for *dinner*.""

It's totally ridiculous to claim that because there is equal gender representation there must be a competence gap."

So why would they release them last night, if this were the Russians?"
0,"&gt; Every society, every culture, every nation is different and to discuss politics without cultural context and as some sort of objective thing is redundant.

We are talking about Le Pen, we are talking about France.  What period is she being conservative if the social structures.

&gt;I don't see how ""far right racist"" (your words) contradicts the term conservative at all. 

Depending on the arbitrary time you pick in French society it doesn't, which is why it is just window dressing."

3,"This is a serious big deal and there have been notable victories in the fight against this horrible business.  It's a sad part of the MSM's journalistic malpractice that something every human being should be applauding can not get any mention at all.  Between smears and innuendo, Democrat talking points and grandstanding, they have no intention of covering anything that would look like an accomplishment for the current administration.  It' pathetic and inherently dangerous because they have chosen propaganda over facts and insanity over reason."

0,"Nah
French's system is very different. No chance of a Trump being elected by a minority of people there.
It's direct, and there's two rounds. So even if Le Pen is qualified for the second round, people will massively vote for whoever is left against her."
0,"Yes, let's all vote for the status quo, for no particular reason other than its ""less extreme"".

Edit: For those who think I support Le pen, I do not. I however, see no merit in voting for something based on something as ridiculous as ""moderate"". Explain your decisions and why, don't just throw vague statements. I support Melenchon specifically because of his tax policy for the record."

You are surprised that right wingers typically have opinions that align with right wing ideologies? Really? Are we also part of some evil conspiracy because us non-right wingers dislike Trump, Le Pen and Wilders? "

Stop moving the goalposts and stop pretending to be a concerned left-winger. It‚Äôs deceitful, dishonest and disingenuous. 

If you have to pretend to be someone else, if you need to push fake viewpoints that you don‚Äôt really hold, to try and get what you want and push your agenda, it should tell you something about which side you‚Äôre on.

Absolutely shameful, honestly...

Be better, or at least own your cruel, shitty, outdated politics and be yourself."

I think France is already too far gone, and they should protect their borders (from the Mediterranean) as well as slow down legal immigration until they can actually get these Macron-promised integration policies in place.

3,Le Penn has exactly 0 policies that align with Neoliberal priorities.
3,"That's where you're wrong, kiddo. 

Everyone voted for trump thinking he wouldn't be that bad. He hasn't even elected any state officials yet. No wall. Self proclaimed globalist. Hires an advisor who actively says he's trying to burn the government down. Spends most of his time transferring money to his private businesses and staying at them to force America to pay for his security. 

Le Pen happily allies herself with Trump and Putin. Same thing, buddy. She'll loot the country and do none of what she's promising. 

Don't tell people to commit suicide. "

Let's say that crime against humanity is actually an incrimination defined by the Rome Statute and punished by the International Criminal Court, so if you make such bold claim you should prepare to have it challenged and be ready to substantiate it clearly. Which he didn't.

2,Lmfao To Kill a Mockingbird is not only one of the greatest pieces of American literature to ever be written(probably THE greatest) but it‚Äôs also one of the greatest pieces of anti racist literature ever written. The entire premise of the book is how even in backwards ass early 1900s Alabama that even a black man deserved a fair trial in court and he shouldn‚Äôt simply be judged as guilty bc a bunch of good ole boys deemed him so.

2,"We need to help them more and help them integrate as best as we can. 

And given how half of Europe is experiencing population shortages and chronic unemployment, you can tell that the main opposition to the refugees is plain old racism. Farage, Wilders, and Le Pen want to solve the problem by having the white populations breed like the Nazis wanted their women to breed, not by bringing in scared refugees with a different skin color and a religion that's essentially the same man in the clouds that Christians and Jews worship."

0,"No CDU politician can match her popularity. There is no one to replace her, there was not even a challenger. 

But still Germany is somehow looking for some sort of change although maybe not in the sense that people here are looking for. Martin Schulz embodies some pro-Europe message that resonates with the people's high favorability of the EU. It's comparable to the rising chances of Macron in France. Most of the Central Europeans are looking for an alternative to the anti-European messages of AfD, Front National, FP√ñ, etc. Even Wilders is down again by some points."

Which I think it is also dangerous af to just casually compare someone like Soros, to the Koch Brothers.  One is clearly, more aggressively disruptive and invasive."

1,"What purism? We had Hollander and Sarkozy the last 10 years, and still all our evils are because of some purist leftism that was never in power in the fifth republic?

He thinks leftism is at the root of all evils, but wants leftists to vote for him and by extension against a leftist economic policy. No way. Win the election with your voter base since apparently we've been the ones ruining France with our rights and protections."

0,"The reaction from Trumpist Le Pen supporters seems to be ""France is lost, RIP"" ie: they accept the results of the election, but they don't see it as a good thing.
