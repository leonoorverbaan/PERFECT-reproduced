## PERFECT: Prompt-free and Efficient Few-shot Learning with Language Models

### Introduction
PERFECT is an approach to few-shot learning that doesn't require manual prompts or task-specific instructions. Instead, it uses the power of large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 to learn new tasks from just a few examples. So PERFECT works by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a small amount of labeled data from a new task. The key innovation is to use a meta-learning algorithm that optimizes the fine-tuning process across multiple tasks, allowing the model to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data.
